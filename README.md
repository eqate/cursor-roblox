> [!WARNING]
> You must go to downloads and name it Setup, and this only works using bloxstrap (for now) <https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap>

> [!WARNING]
> This may not work sometimes because it isnt updated for the latest bloxstrap version (roblox too) simply just wait for our developers to fix this to the newest.
